# keras-transform
Library for data augmentation

This library will provide a data augmentation pipeline for `Sequence` objects.

**Keras-transform** allows the user to specify a mask to do data augmentation on the groundtruth or any way you would like.
See [simple.ipynb](examples/simple.ipynb).

# Contributing
Anyone can contribute by submitting a PR, but remember that the code is in a super early stage so things may change.
Also, a lot of documentation needs to be done.
Any PR that adds a new feature needs to be tested.
